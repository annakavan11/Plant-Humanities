Popular name for a variety of fictive lands in Greek mythology, but also an oft-used epithet for the Canary Islands. This name dates back to Antiquity, when Pliny the Elder wrote of a set of islands far to the south and off the west coast of Africa, naming them "The Fortunate Islands" in volume six of his _Historia naturalis_.
