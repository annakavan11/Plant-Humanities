# André Pierre Ledru

André Pierre Ledru (1761-1825) was a french naturalist, botanist, and theologian born in Chantenay, France. Ledru devoted his early career to ecclesiastical pursuits, before revolutionary politics in France forced him to abandon his religious background and devote his attentions to botany and the natural sciences. As such, Ledru joined Captain Nicolas Baudin's (1754-1803) Belle Angélique expedition from 1796-1798. This journey, sponsored by the newly-founded Muséum Nationale d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, brought Ledru to the Canary Islands and various Carribean isles. Upon the expedition's successful return home to France, their recently amassed natural collections were incorporated in Napoleon Bonaparte's triumphal procession through the streets of Paris on July 27, 1798. Ledru recounted his voyage in his 1810 book Voyage aux Iles de Ténériffe, la Trinité, Saint-Thomas, Sainte Croix et Porto-Ricco, which followed his considerably shorter article published one year earlier (1809) in Mémoires de l'Académie Celtique, "Les cérémonies religieuses et le vocabulaire des Guanches, premiers habitants des îles Canaries." Ledru's collection of over 6,000 herbarium specimens was one of the most expansive private botanical collections in the world at the time of his death in La Sarthe in 1825 and, as such, the collection was donated to the Muséum Nationale d'Histoire Naturelle. Many of his specimens still reside there today.
